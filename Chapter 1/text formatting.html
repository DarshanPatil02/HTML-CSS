    <!-- <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am Darshan Patil working as Data Scientist Intern. These days I am learning Deep learning for youtube(almost done and soon I am going to start working on projects). I've created this github profile to share my programming knowledge with all of you and you guys are great. Thank you so much for following me.</p>

    <p>I am very introvert and shy person and I don't speak much with others expect my friends but If someone is talking about cricket or programming I take interest in conversations. Since I was not good in making new friends I used to talk to my online friends but I could never really........... Comment if you want to know more about me. </p</p> -->
